```18. Exemplificarea isolation levels prin exemple de tranzacții care se execută în paralel în condiții de concurență, evidențiind efectele diferitelor niveluri de izolare asupra concurenței și integrității datelor.```

In SQL there are different [isolation levels](https://asktom.oracle.com/Misc/oramag/on-transaction-isolation-levels.html) when working with multiple queries / transactions in parallel. 

Each level allows certain unsafe operations and race conditions, such as reading data that hasn't been commited yet.

The base race conditions in SQL are: 


- Dirty read: The meaning of this term is as bad as it sounds. You're permitted to read uncommitted, or dirty , data. You can achieve this effect by just opening an OS file that someone else is writing and reading whatever data happens to be there. Data integrity is compromised, foreign keys are violated, and unique constraints are ignored.

- Nonrepeatable read: This simply means that if you read a row at time T1 and try to reread that row at time T2, the row may have changed. It may have disappeared, it may have been updated, and so on.

- Phantom read: This means that if you execute a query at time T1 and re-execute it at time T2, additional rows may have been added to the database, which may affect your results. This differs from a nonrepeatable read in that with a phantom read, data you already read hasn't been changed, but instead, more data satisfies your query criteria than before.

Important: To do this, you must open multiple concurrent transactions in your SQL IDE. 
This is generally done by simply opening multiple consoles. 
For instance, in DataGrip:

Each of them is called a session. 

## 1. Read Commited Level 

Note: this is also the implicit Oracle isolation level.

Session 1: 
```SQL
-- manually set the isolation level 
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- read an employee's salary
SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100;
```

Session 2: SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100;
```SQL
-- Change the salary of the same employee
UPDATE employees SET salary = 20000 WHERE employee_id = 100;
COMMIT;
```

Session 1: 
```SQL
-- read the salary again
SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100;
```

From this we can notice that, in a session, we can read the same data twice with different results. This is nonrepeatable read. 


## 2. Repetable Read Level 

This is an SQL isolation level that prevents the problem discussed previously. 
The equivalent in Oracle is the serializable level. 

Session 1: 
```SQL
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100;
```

Session 2: 
```SQL
-- Try to update the row that session 1 already read
UPDATE employees SET salary = 25000 WHERE employee_id = 100;
COMMIT;
-- The changes won't be executed until session 1 does a commit or rollback
```

Session 1: 
```SQL
-- read the salary again
SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 100;
```
This time the salary read on session 1 will be the same as before. 

## 3. Read Uncommmited Level 

This is an isolation level that allows you to read data changed in other sessions even before they commited it. 
This level doesn't exist at all in Oracle. 

## 4. Phantom Read Issue 

This is a condition allowed on all isolation levels except Serializable. 

It's similar to Repetable Read, but instead of being about changed data, it's about a session inserting a new row in a table, and the other session picking it up, resulting in inconsistent data reads. 

Oracle prevents this in its Serialization level: 

Session 1: 
```SQL
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- Count the employees in department 90 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 90;
```

Session 2: 
```SQL
-- Try to insert a new employee into department 90 
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, department_id)
VALUES (300, 'Test', 'User', 'test@example.com', SYSDATE, 'IT_PROG', 90);
-- It will be stuck or throw ORA-08177
COMMIT;
```
